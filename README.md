# GECT Facilities Maintenance App

## About The Project

This Flutter application is designed by S6 CSE students of Government Engineering College, Thrissur as part of their mini-project. It aims to streamline the process of managing electrical and plumbing maintenance complaints within a college. Through the app, Heads of Departments (HODs) can file complaints which are then appropriately routed to respective officials to handle them. This system facilitates efficient handling and resolution of maintenance issues.

### Features

- **Complaint Registration:** HODs can file electrical and plumbing complaints via the app.
- **Complaint Routing:** Automated routing directs complaints to the correct in-charge based on the type of issue.
- **Approval and Decline:** Complaints can be either approved or declined by the responsible in-charge.
- **Task Assignment:** Approved complaints are forwarded to the sergeant for assignment to the relevant maintenance worker.
- **Feedback on Complaints:** Declined complaints are communicated back to the complainant with reasons for the decline.
- **Visibility:** All complaints are accessible to HODs, the sergeant, and the principal.
